# Backlog
* dynamic decision of which energy to harvest from
* harvester: implement storage usage
* how to build roads that screeps will use
* upgrader: need to use upgraders to keep decaying buildings
* spawner: track how much resources are being produced per tick to see what we can keep up with, a bookkeeper of sorts
* automated construction site, creeps can setup a construction site to have containers near it so that its easy to build new things

# To Do
* think about multi-room design
* dynamic creep task allocation
* move filename format to "[alpha|beta|prod].<FUNCTION_GROUP>.<FUNCTION>.js" to make it easier to organize and use different versions of the files.
  * eg: alpha.system.spawner.js

# In Progress
* fixing the spawning system so it doesn't kill our base by not spawning things
    * spawn screeps based on need and available memory
* fixing the dead screeps in memory bug, currently prevents the requested spawn
