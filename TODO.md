# TODO

### Critical
* more specialized workers (heavy harvesters)
* Role juggling for all roles - kind of done
* Repair bot
* Using storage containers

### Important
* Multi-room future?

### Helpful

### For Fun
* Random names rather than time-based

# Known Bugs
* harvester creeps seem to randomly get stuck in `building:true` or `upgrading:true`
  * potential fix in `role.harvester.1.0.js` on line 31
